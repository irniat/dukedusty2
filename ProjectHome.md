This project is part of efforts between Matt Reynolds's lab in Duke and the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech to explore affordable assistive robot technologies.  The main purpose of this project is to explore one aspect of a robot that finds and picks up objects around the household for patients who may be suffering from loss of motor control (e.g. ALS patients) and who, consequently, have a low bandwidth of control.  The research here will focus on a particle filter implementation for localizing RFID tags that are put onto the household objects.  The idea is to get the robot as close as possible to the tags where low-band RFID antennas can then be used to fine-tune the positioning of an arm that retrieves the object.
